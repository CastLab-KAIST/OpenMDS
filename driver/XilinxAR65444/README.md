## Changes

 - Later version of the Linux kernel don't have pci_enable_msix(), so the call was replaced with pci_enable_msix_exact()
 - Added a helper script to automatically build/compile/install the driver on Linux, so that the driver is automatically reloaded on powerup. Tested on Ubuntu 17.10
